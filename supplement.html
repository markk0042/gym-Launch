            <h2>Whey Protein</h2>
            </p>
         </div>
         <div class="tour-text">
            <p>Whey protein is a mixture of proteins isolated from whey, which is the liquid part of milk that separates during cheese production.
Milk actually contains two main types of protein: casein (80%) and whey (20%).
Whey is found in the watery portion of milk. When cheese is produced, the fatty parts of the milk coagulate and the whey is separated from it as a byproduct (3).
If you've ever opened a yogurt container to see liquid floating on top — that’s whey. Cheesemakers used to discard it before they discovered its commercial value (4).
After being separated during cheese production, whey goes through various processing steps to become what people generally recognize as whey protein — a powder that is added to shakes, meal replacements and protein bars (5).
Whey protein doesn't taste very good on its own, which is why it’s usually flavored. Chocolate-, vanilla- and strawberry-flavored powders are popular.
It's important to read the ingredients list, as some products may have unhealthy additives like refined sugar.
Taking whey protein is a convenient way to add protein on top of your daily intake.
This can be important for bodybuilders and gym enthusiasts, as well as people who need to lose weight or are simply lacking protein in their diet.

            <h2>Creatine</h2>
            </p>
         </div>
         <div class="tour-text">
            <p>Creatine is an amino acid located mostly in your body's muscles, as well as in the brain. Though it can be made synthetically, most people get creatine through seafood and red meat. The body's liver, pancreas and kidneys also make creatine.
Your body converts creatine to phosphocreatine and stores it in your muscles, where it's used for energy. As a result, people take creatine orally to improve athletic performance and increase muscle mass.

            <p>These special supplements used prior to a workout are something a person eats or drinks right before undergoing an expected hard workout session. It’s a method of getting all energized prior to starting so that the exerciser can work out harder and last longer without tiring out.
There are several types of nutrition and supplements that can be used by the exerciser. Some are in the form of special drinks, while others are special nutritional bars. In order to get the most out of these pre-workout supplements, the user needs to carefully read the list of ingredients and make sure that they are all healthy and it’s not just a fancy candy bar.

            <p>The State Apartments in Dublin Castle are an extensive suite of rooms which were used by the Lord

               Nowadays these richly decorated rooms are used by the Irish Government for official engagements
               including policy launches, hosting of State Visit ceremonial, and the inauguration of the President
